# 🧩 Interactive Inventory Management System

This project is a **custom-built interactive inventory system**, designed to explore how front-end and back-end components interact within a modular and data-driven environment.  
It was developed as a personal learning project to strengthen skills in **UI development, server logic, and database management**.

---

## 🧠 Overview
The purpose of this system was to understand the full communication cycle between user interfaces, server logic, and persistent data storage.  
I customized and optimized several scripts and configurations to create a stable, efficient, and easy-to-extend architecture.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – Front-end interface and real-time interactivity  
- **Lua** – Back-end scripting and logic control  
- **SQL** – Database design and item data persistence  

---

## 🔍 Features
- Dynamic and responsive inventory interface  
- Real-time communication between client and server  
- Modular architecture for easier scalability and maintenance  
- Database-driven configuration for flexible data updates  
- Optimized event handling and system performance
