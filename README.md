# Interactive Server Management System

This project is a customized interactive server built using an existing framework as a foundation.  
It was developed to explore how front-end and back-end components communicate and how system configurations affect performance and stability.

## 🧠 Overview
The goal of this project was to understand the full workflow between the user interface, server logic, and database operations.  
I customized and optimized scripts, settings, and events to adapt the system to my own needs while improving its functionality.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – Front-end interface and interactivity  
- **Lua** – Server-side scripting and logic  
- **SQL** – Database design and data management  

## 🔍 Features
- Real-time communication between client and server  
- Modular code structure for easier maintenance  
- Database integration for data persistence  
- Performance optimization and configuration tuning  

## 🚀 What I Learned
- Understanding existing codebases and frameworks  
- Connecting front-end and back-end logic  
- Managing configurations and optimizing server performance  
- Applying good programming practices in an autonomous environment
